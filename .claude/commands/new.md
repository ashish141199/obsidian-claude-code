description: Create a new topic with proper title, concise content, and smart linking
---

Create a new topic note in `Topics/` folder:

**CRITICAL - Before Creating:**
- **Search EXTENSIVELY first** - Use Grep/Glob to check if topic already exists
- **Check similar/related topics** - Search for synonyms, related concepts
- **Prefer editing existing** - If similar topic exists, ask user if they want to update that instead
- **Create ONLY if genuinely new** - Must be a unique concept not already in vault
- Fast parallel searches - batch operations to scan vault quickly

1. **Ask the user** what topic they want to create (if not provided)
2. **Search existing vault** - Read relevant notes to find linking opportunities
3. **Create the topic note** using Topic template with:
   - Clear, concise core idea (2-3 sentences MAX)
   - Relevant details (brief, not verbose)
   - **Critical: Add 3-5 [[wiki links]]** to related topics, MOCs, or concepts in "Related Topics" section
4. **Link intelligently** - Connect to existing topics, create new ones if concepts don't exist yet

**Style rules:**
- Short, atomic content (one main idea)
- Dense with [[links]] - networked thinking
- No fluff or verbose explanations
- Focus on connections over completeness

**CRITICAL Linking Rule:**
- **ANY noun → [[wiki link]]** - If you write any word that is a noun (person, place, thing, concept), wrap it in [[ ]]
- **ANY year → [[wiki link]]** - Years also get links: [[2025]], [[2024]], etc.
- Create topic note if important noun doesn't exist yet
- Examples: [[Project]], [[Technology]], [[Cloud Service]], [[Protocol]], [[Development]], [[2025]]
- Don't overthink - more links = better graph connectivity
