description: Answer questions using vault knowledge - short, concise, linked
---

Answer from existing vault knowledge:

**CRITICAL - Search First:**
- **Use existing vault knowledge** - Fast parallel Grep/Read operations
- **Never create new files** - This command is read-only, answer from what exists
- **If gap exists** - Direct to /research, don't make up content

1. **Search vault** - Grep/Read relevant topics, daily notes, MOCs
2. **Synthesize answer** using ONLY vault content:
   - **1-3 sentences maximum** (unless complex question requires more)
   - Include [[wiki links]] to relevant vault notes
   - Reference which notes the answer comes from
3. **If knowledge gap exists:**
   - State it briefly
   - Suggest using `/research` to fill the gap

**Critical rules:**
- SHORT answers (no verbose explanations)
- Link to vault notes with [[links]]
- If not in vault, say so - don't make up content
- Concise > comprehensive

**CRITICAL Linking Rule:**
- **ANY noun → [[wiki link]]** - If you write any word that is a noun (person, place, thing, concept), wrap it in [[ ]]
- **ANY year → [[wiki link]]** - Years also get links: [[2025]], [[2024]], etc.
- Link to existing vault notes aggressively
- Examples: [[Platoona MVP]], [[Fundraising]], [[Integration Architecture]], [[2025]]
- Don't overthink - more links = better graph connectivity

**Style:**
Direct, minimal, linked. Think: "What's the essential answer + where to learn more?"
