description: Conversational daily logging with smart linking to vault topics
---

Interactive daily note capture:

**CRITICAL - File Management:**
- **Search existing topics FIRST** - Grep for topics mentioned in conversation
- **Link to existing topics** - Don't create new topics if related ones exist
- **Create new topic ONLY if** person/concept/project genuinely new to vault
- Fast searches - batch Grep operations to find existing topics quickly

1. **Listen** to what the user shares about their day
2. **Ask 1-2 follow-up questions** to clarify or deepen:
   - Key decisions or insights
   - Connections to ongoing projects
   - Notable ideas or challenges
3. **Create/update today's daily note** in `Daily Notes/` with:
   - Summary of the day (3-5 bullet points, concise)
   - Key insights or decisions
   - **Critical: Add [[wiki links]]** to relevant topics, projects, people
   - Suggestions for new topics if concepts emerge
4. **Suggest topic creation** if new ideas came up during conversation

**Conversational style:**
- Brief, friendly questions
- Active listening
- Find connections to existing vault knowledge
- Maximum linking to Topics/ and MOCs/

**Logging format:**
- Short bullets, not paragraphs
- Dense with [[connections]]
- Capture essence, not everything
- Link to people, projects, concepts mentioned

**CRITICAL Linking Rule:**
- **ANY noun → [[wiki link]]** - If you write any word that is a noun (person, place, thing, concept), wrap it in [[ ]]
- **ANY year → [[wiki link]]** - Years also get links: [[2025]], [[2024]], etc.
- Create topic note if important noun doesn't exist yet
- Examples: [[Project Name]], [[Person Name]], [[Concept]], [[Tool Name]], [[Strategy]], [[2025]]
- Don't overthink - more links = better graph connectivity
