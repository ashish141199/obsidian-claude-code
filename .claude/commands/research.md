description: Deep research with websearch, create linked topic with findings
---

Research mode with networked knowledge capture:

**CRITICAL - File Management:**
- **Search existing topics FIRST** - Use Grep/Glob to find related topics quickly
- **Prefer editing existing topics** - If related topic exists, UPDATE it instead of creating new
- **Create new topic ONLY if** genuinely new concept not already covered
- Speed is key - batch search operations, scan vault fast

1. **Clarify research query** (if needed - be brief)
2. **Deep research** using WebSearch extensively:
   - Search multiple angles
   - Find key insights, patterns, examples
   - Identify related concepts
3. **Create topic note** in `Topics/` with research findings:
   - Core insight (concise)
   - Key findings (bullet points, not paragraphs)
   - Sources in "Sources & References"
   - **Critical: Link to 5+ related concepts** using [[wiki links]]
4. **Suggest new topics** that emerged during research (create them if user wants)

**Research depth:**
- Use --think or --think-hard flags for complex topics
- Multiple search queries for comprehensive coverage
- Synthesize into SHORT, linked notes - no long reports

**Style:**
- Dense information, minimal words
- Maximum [[connections]]
- Actionable insights over background info
