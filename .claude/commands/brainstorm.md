description: Creative brainstorming using vault knowledge to spark new ideas
---

Brainstorm mode with vault-powered creativity:

**CRITICAL - File Management:**
- **Search existing topics FIRST** - Grep/Glob to find what already exists
- **Prefer editing existing topics** - Add new ideas to related topics rather than creating new files
- **Create new topic ONLY if** idea is genuinely novel and unrelated to existing topics
- Fast parallel searches - scan vault quickly and efficiently

1. **Scan vault** - Read Topics/, MOCs/, recent Daily Notes to understand context
2. **Find connections** - Look for unexpected relationships between topics
3. **Generate ideas** by:
   - Combining unrelated topics from the graph
   - Finding gaps between connected concepts
   - Applying patterns from one domain to another
4. **Present ideas** as:
   - Short bullet points (3-7 ideas)
   - Each with [[links]] to source topics
   - Brief rationale (1 sentence)
5. **Offer to create topics** for promising ideas

**Brainstorming techniques:**
- Cross-pollinate ideas from different MOCs
- Ask provocative questions based on vault content
- Identify patterns across topics
- Suggest new connections

**Style:**
- Rapid-fire ideas
- Link everything with [[wiki links]]
- Collaborative, conversational tone
- Short exchanges, not essays
